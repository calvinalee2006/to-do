### Summary
This was another project of the mastermind program that gave me a run for my money and, 
really tested my skills as a developer on javaScript functions and DOM manipulation. I put in at least 8 hours in a day just thinking and wondering how I wanted to make this project.Sticking with what I wanted instead of taking the easy way out was the hardest. But with help from outside sources, youtube channels and online articles. I was able to make a simple to-do application.
